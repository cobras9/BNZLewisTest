# BNZLewisTest
BNZ Mobile  Tech test

Please produce a native application that downloads and displays the list of schools from the below
API.
https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=20b7c271-fd5a-4c9e-
869b-481a0e2453cd&limit=20
While the finished application is important, the main aim of the test is to see how you write code.
Write what you would consider production ready code, making use of any 3rd-party libraries that you
would normally utilise.
A reference design is shown below.
When you are finished upload your source code to a public source control repository and then send
the link to your hiring manager at BNZ.

Implementation phases

1) Models + DI
2) Network call
3) UI Compose components
4) Tests (Unit, UI) ---> With TDD this should be done first
